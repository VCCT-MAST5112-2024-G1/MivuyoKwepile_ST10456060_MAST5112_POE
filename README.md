A delete button was implemented to remove items from the menu.
The button dynamically changes from "Add Dish" to "Update Dish" depending on whether the chef is adding a new dish or editing an existing one.
A section at the bottom of the home screen was added to calculate and display the average price for each course.
The average price is calculated for each category (Drink, Starter, Main, Dessert) by filtering menu items by course and averaging the prices.
A "Submit" button was added to the View Menu screen. When pressed, the selected items from the "AddDishScreen" are added to the global menu array.
A new screen was added for filtering menu items by course (Drink, Starter, Main, Dessert).
A "Reset Filter" button was added to restore the full menu.
A "Back to Home" button was added to navigate back to the Home screen.
A "Filter Menu" button was added to the Home screen, which navigates to the FilterScreen.
Menu items were passed between screens using navigation and state management.
The menu items are stored in a state and passed between screens, allowing the chef to add, edit, or delete menu items across screens.
